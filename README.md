# C Pointer Error: Incorrect Dereferencing

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming related to pointer usage. The provided code snippet shows how incorrect dereferencing can lead to unexpected changes in the value of a variable. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides the corrected version.

## Bug Description
The original code attempts to modify the value of a variable through a pointer, but does so incorrectly. This may produce unintended consequences and lead to subtle errors that are hard to detect. 

## Solution
The solution code rectifies the issue by correctly using the pointer to modify the intended variable. This ensures that the variable's value is updated as expected. It also provides best practices for using pointers in C to avoid similar errors.
